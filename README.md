# RecoRail

RecoRail is a recommendation simulator built with React and Vite.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Local Backend
A simple Node/Express backend serves menu items and recommendation logic used by the simulator, menu items, and logs pages.

To start it locally you have two options:

```bash
# run the express server (used during development)
npm install        # ensure dependencies are installed
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 npm run backend
# or simply `npm run backend` on Windows PowerShell, then set the env var in
# the terminal where you launch the frontend as below
```

When running the React app you can point it at the local server by setting:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 npm run dev
```

If `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is not provided the frontend will call the built‑in
serverless functions under `/api` (this is what happens in production on
Vercel).

### Deploying to Vercel
Push the repository to a Git provider (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) and import
it in Vercel. The `api/` directory contains the serverless endpoints, which
will automatically be served under `/api/*`. No extra configuration is needed.
The app itself will be built by Vite and served statically. State is in-memory
on each function invocation, so menu items/logs reset when the function cold
starts.
The API endpoints are:

- `GET /menu-items` — list items (sorted newest first)
- `POST /menu-items` — create a new item
- `PUT /menu-items/:id` — update an item
- `DELETE /menu-items/:id` — remove an item
- `POST /recommend` — body includes cart_items, meal_time, cuisine, user_segment, city; returns up to 6 recommendations
- `GET /logs` — returns recommendation logs
- `POST /logs` — create a log entry

Menu items are seeded with sample data on first server start; state is persisted to `backend/data.db` using SQLite. Logs are also stored there and survive restarts.
